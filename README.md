Video Selector Application - Created using npx Create-React-App

Frontend Developer Coding Exercise 
Selector Challenge 
Using JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a simple video selector. The selector should include a UI to display a "card" for each video item. Use either vanilla JS or a framework of your choice.  

●	Read from the included JSON file. The structure of this object mimics that of a Meredith Digital custom ad server’s response. Note that not all properties will be needed for this challenge -- part of the process is determining the relevant data to process.
●	For each entry in the video selector section, display the following:

     ○	Title

     ○	Description

     ○	Thumbnail

     ○	Duration

●	On click of a card, display a video player that loads the corresponding video file
